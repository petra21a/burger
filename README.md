## Assignment Challenge
In this activity, we built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app structure. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. This is the first 'full-stack' application challenge.

## Technical Approach
- The challenge of this assignment was integration. Returning to the 'front-end' after a few weeks while also practicing modularization and the a basic MVC sturcture. Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, the most frustrating portion was dealing with modals in Materialize again.
