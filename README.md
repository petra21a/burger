## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) following MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Technical Approach
- The challenge of this assignment was integration: using Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. I attempted challenge myself by bringing back part of the GIPHY API using ajax from a previous assigned challenge and digging further into environmental variable.
